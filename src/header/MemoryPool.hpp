// adding this file here as a place holder
// right now I am not sure if I want to build my own or use an existing one
// the idea is I will pass nodes arround in my data structrue for big primes
// this way I never have to alloc or free memory in vectors or have static
// amounts in arrays it might be a bit slower but will need to test it out
// will try to make the data strcuture class such that I can place either or
// in to test speed and stuff
